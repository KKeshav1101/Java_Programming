Interthread communication
1.wait()
2.notfy()
3.notifyAll()
4.-final
deadlock- when two processes are trying to access the same resource 
        - first process might wait for the second and the second might wait for the first
        - this will result in neither going forward and thus a deadlock.
        - so dont use wait without notify and vice versa
