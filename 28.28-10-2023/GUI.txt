EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING
--------------------------------
DELEGATION EVEN MODEL
	#Event source
		-raises an event- need not be a visible and tangible element in gui
		-ex:button, timer, frame, Mouse
	#Event
		-ActionEvent=>raised when mouse clicks on button
			MouseEvent
			MouseMotionEvent
	#Listener(interface)
		-Responsible for handling the event- (it is delegated with the event handling by event source)
		-use ActionListener to handle actions related to the button
		-actionPerformed()-must be overriden
		ex:
			MouseListener
				-mousePressed()
				-mouseReleased()
				-mouseClicked()
			MouseMotionListener
				-mouseMoved()
				-moseDragged()

Register Listener to the event:
		addTypeListener()-to register listener in event source
		removeTypeListener()-to unregister listener in event source
