/*final keyword
no more change
final data member-final member function and final class
if u want to fix a constant for the entire class- then u use this- once initialised cant change
if the function is a final function - the defn can't be further changed. So basically overriding isnt possible
if the class is a final class- inheritance itself is denied (cant use extends keyword on it)
abstract in c++ is similar to interface- where objects arent created for the class-it is used only for inheritance*/
//sample//
class Test{
	final double pi=3.14;
	
}
//final class A{
//<Code>
//}
//class B extends A is thus impossible
//but final class A extends B is possible obviously
