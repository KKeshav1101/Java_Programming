/*MULTITHREADING
Thread- execution point
multithreading- helps have several execution points running parallelly, conccurent execution
java.lang.Thread and java.lang.Runnable are two classes we will be using
the thread in execution is known as running state
runnable state means the thread is ready for execution-thus the difference b/w running and runnable
New ------start()-----> Runnable -----run()-----> Running -----sleep(long int //in ms//)---> Blocked //sleep is timed
							       suspend()--------------->Blocked	//resumes based on event
							       wait()------------------>Blocked //also different from sleep but is timed
from any state -----stop()---->Dead

resume()-suspend() complimentary pair for sync
wait()-notify() for communication
								
producer is the part of the code thats responsible for filling the data
consumer takes the data- thus the dependency b/w producer and consumer
if there is a common resource that has to be accessed by more than one thread- thread synchronisation is necessary
communication between the threads is diff tho and its called messaging
